## How to Enable Data Analytics:

1.	Understand Business Needs: Start by identifying key business objectives. Interview stakeholders to understand what decisions they want to drive with data (e.g., customer segmentation, performance tracking).
2.	Gather Requirements: Define the data sources, types of analysis, and the infrastructure needed (e.g., data warehouses, cloud storage). Prioritize based on business impact.
3.	Design Data Pipeline:
	•	Ingestion: Identify data sources and build ETL processes to move data into storage.
	•	Transformation: Apply necessary data transformations for reporting or model-building.
	•	Storage: Store data in a scalable system like a data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).
	•	Access: Ensure stakeholders can access and visualize the data (e.g., through dashboards or APIs).
4.	Deploy & Monitor: Automate ETL processes, deploy monitoring tools, and ensure data integrity.
